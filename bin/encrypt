# Encrypts the input directory using 7-Zip.
# To decrypt the result, do "7z x result.7z"
# WARNING: this will overwrite anything in its way (it will warn you first).

# Explanation:
# `7z` calls the 7-Zip program. See "man 7zip" for more information.
# `a` means will add all files from the input directory.
# `-p' will password-protect the result with AES-256 encryption.
# `-mhe=on' will encrypt metadata, including file names.
# `-mx=0' means that the data will not be compressed.
# `"$1".zip' will name the result the input argument plus the .7z extension.
# `"$1"` will use the input argument as the input directory.
